    "text": "Abstract. This research report explores how Bayesian VARs model predict AUD/USD exchange rate. Keywords. Bayesian Vars, Exchange rate\n\n\nObjective and Motivation\nThe objective of this research is to use the Bayesian Vector Autoregressions (VARs) method to forecast the exchange rate of the US dollar exchange rate against the Australian dollar.\nThe ability to accurately forecast the foreign exchange rate is crucial for Australia’s global trade and investment. Given the prominence of the US dollar as the world’s primary reserve currency, the monetary policies of the US Federal Reserve have a worldwide effect on the world economy, its significant influence on the Australia currency market should be important for domestic investors and policy maker as it can directly impact the AUD/USD exchange rate. Besides, America as one of the major trading partners for Australia, can impact bilateral trade flows and eventually affect the value of the AUD. Apart from the external from foreign countries, the domestic economic indicators can also be one of the determinants of the AUD/USD exchange rate.\nThe research is aimed to address the question for example, how the AUD/USD exchange rate will be in 3 months or even longer 1 year?\n\n\nData and Variables\nTo better forecast the change in the exchange rate, the 12 variables are selected as follows which contain both domestic and US economic indicators that affect the exchange rate in different ways.\nReal GDP and interest rates have a significant effect on the exchange rate, a higher realGDP and interest rate in Australia may increase the demand for AUD, which will lead to an appreciation of AUD and a rise in the AUD/USD exchange rate. A higher CPI indicates a lower purchasing power relative to foreign currency which may lead to a depreciation of the domestic currency. The unemployment rate can in some way represent business activity and a country with a high unemployment rate will lower the attractiveness for foreign investors and weaken the domestic currency competitiveness in the currency market. The balance of trade, which is the difference between exports and imports, also can influence the demand for its currency, a trade surplus in AUD may increase the demand for AUD dollar.\n\n\\(erate_{t}\\): AUD/USD exchange rate\nAUS economic indicators\n\n\\(crateau_{t}\\): The Cash Rate Target, Australia\n\\(rgdpau_{t}\\): The Real Gross Domestic Product, Australia\n\\(cpiau_{t}\\): The Consumer Price Index, Australia\n\\(unemrau_{t}\\): The Unemployment rate, Australia\n\\(imporau_{t}\\): The Imports of Goods and Services, Australia\n\\(exporau_{t}\\): The Exports of Goods and Services, Australia\n\nUS economic indicators\n\n\\(crateus_{t}\\): The Federal Funds Effective Rate, United States\n\\(rgdpus_{t}\\): The Real Gross Domestic Product, United States\n\\(cpius_{t}\\): The Consumer Price Index, United States\n\\(unemrus_{t}\\): The Unemployment rate, United States\n\\(imporus_{t}\\): The Imports of Goods and Services, United States\n\\(exporus_{t}\\): The Exports of Goods and Services, United States\n\n\n\nData Cleaning\nFor the data cleaning part, most data for AUS is from Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), and data for the US is from FRED, the dataset spans from 1990 Q1 to 2023 Q4, comprising 136 observations. To better fit the model, the data has been transformed to ‘quarter’ to ensure that seasonality effects are removed and logged transformations have been applied to most data except exchange rate and cash rate to reducing outlier effects.\n\nVisualisation of data\nPlot the variables to see the patterns of data. It shows from the plots that the exchange rate and cash rate for the US fluctuate over time, the cash rate and unemployment for AU show a downward trend and all other variables have a clear upward trend, with the exports、imports, and GDP for both countries have a clear drop during the COVID-19 period.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince most variables show a non-stationary pattern. To determine whether a unit root is present in a time series dataset, the ADF test will be conducted below.\n\n\nAugmented Dickey-Fuller test for log transformed variables except exchange rates and cash rates.\nFrom the plot we can observe all ACF plots have a high degree of persistence over time, indicating there is significant autocorrelation in the time series data.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is the p-value of each variable and only the cash rate for AUS has a p-value less than 0.05 which indicates that \\(crateau_{t}\\) is stationary.\n\n\n                   P-value\nexchange rate        0.736\ncpi_au               0.214\ncpi_us               0.450\ncashrate_au          0.010\ncashrate_us          0.270\nexport_au            0.498\nexport_us            0.365\nimport_au            0.184\nimport_us            0.603\nrealgdp_au           0.961\nrealgdp_us           0.633\nunemployemtrate_au   0.354\nunemployemtrate_us   0.358\n\n\nBelow is the ADF test result for all non-stationary data taking the first difference. All variables in the first differences are stationary as the null hypothesis of non-stationary can be rejected.\n\n\n                   P-value\nexchange rate        0.010\ncpi_au               0.027\ncpi_us               0.024\ncashrate_us          0.010\nexport_au            0.010\nexport_us            0.010\nimport_au            0.010\nimport_us            0.010\nrealgdp_au           0.010\nrealgdp_us           0.010\nunemployemtrate_au   0.010\nunemployemtrate_us   0.010\n\n\nIt can be concluded that all variables are integrated at 1 with \\(crateau_{t}\\) being the only stationary so the first difference should be taken to keep the time series stationary.\n\n\n\n\nModel and Hypotheses\nIn this research, the VAR(p) model will be applied to forecast the AUD/USD exchange rate, below is the basic model that is used in this research.\n\nThe basic VAR(p) model\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\ny_{t}=\\mu_{0}+A_{1}y_{t-1}+\\cdots+A_{p}y_{t-p}+\\epsilon_{t} \\\\\n\\epsilon_{t}|Y_{t-1}\\sim iid(0_{12},\\Sigma)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nWhere N = 12 and \\(y_{t}\\) is a vector of 12 variables.\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\ny_{t}=\\begin{pmatrix}\ncrateau_{t} \\\\\nrgdpau_{t}\\\\\ncpiau_{t} \\\\\nunemrau_{t}\\\\\nimporau_{t} \\\\\nexporau_{t} \\\\\ncrateus_{t} \\\\\nrgdpus_{t} \\\\\ncpius_{t} \\\\\nunemrus_{t} \\\\\nimporus_{t}\\\\\nexporus_{t}\\\\\n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nThe Matrix notation\n\\[\\begin{align}\nY =XA+E\\\\\nE|X\\sim \\mathcal{MN}_{T\\times N}(0, \\Sigma, I_T)\\\\\nY|X,A,\\Sigma\\sim \\mathcal{MN}_{T\\times N} (XA, \\Sigma, I_T)\n\\end{align}\\]\nWhere \\(Y\\) is a \\(T\\times 12\\) Matrix, \\(X\\) is a \\(T\\times(1+p\\times12)\\), \\(A\\) is a \\((1+p\\times12)\\times12\\) matrix that contains \\(\\mu_{0}\\) and vectors of the autoregressive slope parameters and \\(E\\) is a \\(T\\times12\\) matrix contains vetors of error terms.\nFor further research, we may use the predictive density function like 1-period forecast and forecast with Bayesian VARS."
